# GroceryStore
Object Oriented Program implementation of a grocery store.

My project is a program that helps store owners manage their stores in Java. It allows them to track the items they have in stock, calculate prices and quantities, and potentially assist with other tasks related to store management. The program includes the Item and GroceryStore classes, with the Item class representing the products that the store sells.
