# Grocery Store Management System

# Project Title

Grocery Store Management Program
## Description

My project is a program that helps grocery store owners/store owners manage their stores. It allows them to track the items they have in stock, calculate prices and quantities, and potentially assist with other tasks related to store management. Lots of useful commands added for store owners to use.

The program is implemented using object-oriented programming in Java, and consists of two main classes: the Item class, which represents the products that the store sells, and the GroceryStore class, which represents the store itself. There is also an employee class, which are the employees that work in the store. There is also a saving system in which every data you submit in the program will be stored into the MySQL database so that it saves when you close it and can load the state it was currently in when you closed the program.

The GUI and Java classes was done in VS code with MySQL as the Database.

### Installing

To execute and run the GUI, make sure you have the Java Development Kit installed first before running it on an IDE like VS code or Eclispe otherwise it will not work.
