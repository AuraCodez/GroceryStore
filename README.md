# GroceryStore
My Object Oriented Program design and implementation of a store in Java. Three classes consist of : Employees, Item, GroceryStore

My project is a comprehensive inventory management software designed to assist grocery store owners and managers in efficiently tracking and organizing their inventory and pricing. With this application, store owners can easily add and remove items, update stock levels, and calculate the total value of all goods in the store. The program is highly customizable and can be used by any type of store, not just grocery stores. It can also hire employees and keep track of the employees in the given store.

Main Features

   - Add new items to the store with a name, price, and stock quantity
   - Remove items from the store by name
   - Increase or decrease the stock quantity of an item
   - Get the total price of all items in the store
   - Search for an item by name using binary search algorithm
   - Display a list of all items in the store
 

There are a few improvements I would like to make soon

   - Add the ability to update the price of an item
   - Implement sorting the list of items by name or price
   - Add validation to ensure that the stock quantity is never negative
   - Allow the user to specify the name and price when adding a new item, rather than hardcoding them in the main method
   - Adding in exceptions to deal with errors that may occur when using the program
   - Develop a GUI in Java swing so that this program can have an interface in which people anyone can easily use (In Progress)!!
