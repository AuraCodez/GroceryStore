# GroceryStore
My Object Oriented Program design and implementation of a store in Java.

My Project is a program that is catered towards an implementation of some grocery store (But all stores can use this). It's useful because it can potentially help store owners keep tracking of the items they may have in stock and calculate the prices and quantity of the items.
I have implemented an item and an GroceryStore class, the class item is meant to be the products of the store that they sell.

I am not quite done with this project fully, I am always working towards making new updates and fixing problems when I see them.
