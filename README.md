# GroceryStore
My Object Oriented Program design and implementation of a store in Java.

My project is a program that is catered towards an implementation of some grocery store (But all stores can use this). It's useful because it can potentially help store owners keep tracking of the items they may have in stock and calculate the prices and quantity of the items. 

Features

    Add new items to the store with a name, price, and stock quantity
    Remove items from the store by name
    Increase or decrease the stock quantity of an item
    Get the total price of all items in the store
    Search for an item by name using binary search
    Display a list of all items in the store

I am not quite done with this project fully, I am always working towards making new updates and fixing problems when I see them.
